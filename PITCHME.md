- Matrice 100
- Solo 3DR

Note:
Welcome to KBS. I am the Data manager for the Long Term Ecological Research
program here at KBS. We have recently started to use two aerial platforms
the help us in our research. We have two different aircraft. The larger one is a DGI
Matrice 100. It is equipped with a visual camera as well as a five band camera
that covers blue, green, red, red-edge and near-infrared.  We use this platform
for surveys. Taking pictures of the field. Surveys are conducted by flying at a
constant altitude and taking a lot of overlapping pictures. We then use software
to stitch these images together to form geo-rectified ortho-photos.
The smaller one is the solo 3DR. We use this platform for shortwave radiation
measurements.

# Regulation
Since we are using the air space there are of course Regulations to ensure that
everybody is safe. The Federal Aviation Administration has the primary
responsibility in the US.

There are two broad regulatory schemes that can be used while flying a drone in
the US airspace. One is recreational or hobby use. This is only for strictly
non-commercial activities, for example if I take pictures from a drone for
display to my friends. The other is commercial use, which requires that the
pilot be licensed either under part 107 or under a part 333 exception. If I get
paid for flying I am definitely commercial.

Drones especially those used for commercial use need to be registered with the
FAA and are required to display the number on the body of the air-frame.

# Safety Limits
- Regulatory
- Manufacturer
- Personal

Note:
# Regulatory
The regulations are in force to ensure safety for the public and other aircraft.
Some of the restrictions placed on drone operations are a 400 ft or 121 meter
ceiling. I am not allowed to fly higher than that. Visibility needs to be at
least 3 miles, and I have to stay 500 ft below any clouds. I need to maintain
visual line of sight with the drone.  Flights over people are not allowed.

# Manufacturer
The manufacturer's provide payload limits and maximum wind speed in some cases.

For example on the Solo 3DR the manufacturer lists a maximum wind speed of 24
miles/hr.

# Personal
We take the regulatory limits, the manufacturer's limits and then develop a
series of personal limits based on the situations that we actually fly under,
the loads that we carry and my personal ability to handle the drone with a
sufficient margin of safety. For
example we will not fly if the sustained winds are more than 15 miles/hour, even
though the limit published by the manufacturer is around 24 miles/hour. This
extra margin is to ensure that we will be able to return the drone to the takeoff spot in
case it runs into trouble or when the batteries are depleted. In winds above 10 miles
per hour we would launch the mission upwind so that the return trip would be
with the wind and would be more likely to succeed. By thinking through the
conditions beforehand it is easier to resist the temptation to "push through"
"get the job done" in spite of conditions that might not be safe.

Note:
Just like airplane pilots we use a checklist to make sure we not missing
any details during the operation. Here is the beginning of the Solo 3DR
preflight list. You will note that some of the items are listed more than once,
for example, we re-check that the rotors are secured. Attempting to take off
with one or more rotors loose will result in a very short flight.

# Awareness

Note:
We use automated missions for all of our data flights, but once the fight is
underway it is important to be
able to take control of the drone if something happens. During the mission we
need to scan for birds, and other aircraft.

It is especially important to be aware of the
orientation of the drone at all times. Control inputs are relative to
the drone . For example, if I want the drone to go to my right, and the drone
was pointed away from me,  I would push the
stick to the , but if the drone was pointed towards me, I would have to
push the stick to the left.  Not knowing which way
the drone is pointing could result in creating a collision instead of avoiding
one .

# Uses

- Commercial
- Research

Note:
Surveys for crop stress and pest and nutrient management make up the majority of
current drone applications.

# Research
- Surveys
- Radiation

Note:
During a survey we fly back and forth over the area taking lots of pictures.
They then get stitched together to create the final image.

- Establish maps and measure distances
- Quantify damage
- Count seedlings

- Look for crop stress - NDVI
- Identify species (?)
